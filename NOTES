Failing to directly output packed tanks performance once k * n > L3CNc ^ 2
Actually, failing to actually limit the buffer size tanks performance on > L3CNc, as does failure to do virtual resizes for the tails of a computation
Still, having tails makes things less good

Bug-wise, it helps to not confuse height and width

3.7% improvement on average on big matrices

chaining abstraction introduces about 0.1% overhead over calling gemm() twice on sufficiently large inputs, more overhead on smaller ones
